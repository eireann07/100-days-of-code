# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started JS for dice game project, debugged.

**Thoughts:** Still sort of struggling with getting started with JS. Think I need to slow down and think more about the logic behind what I need the code to do. Losing my patience pretty quickly when things don't work the first time, but that patience will come with time (hopefully)

### Day 1: May 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Advanced JS and DOM for App Brewery; began working with jQuery library. Completed the Drum Kit game project!

**Thoughts:** Remember to proofread! I spent like 20 minutes frustrated with my code...only to see that I misspelled "button"...

### Day 2: May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the jQuery module in App Brewery and the C Arrays lecture in CS50. Began work on the Simon Game for App Brewery and opened the VS code page for CS50 homework. 

**Thoughts:** It's helpful to have Bri along for the journey...I was super skeptical about paired programming and I think a huge part of that was not knowing how to find other programmers. Having a friend who can look at your code is so helpful.

### Day 3: May 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read through the assignment sheet for CS50's readability assignment. Limited progress today; T's wedding rehearsal. 

**Thoughts:** I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to code much this weekend since it's a wedding weekend.

### Day 4: May 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made up for the time lost over the weekend while waiting at the aiport today -- finished readability (in C) for CS50.

**Thoughts:** Having started with Python, C is super frustrating at times.

### Day 5: May 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made really good progress on the Simon game in JS for App Brewery. Finally feel like I'm getting JS more.  

**Thoughts:** In talking with the engineers during the GDI's CF AMA today, JS is a hugely important language. jQuery makes everything so much easier, but I'm worried that I don't have as firm enough of a grip on JS to really do a tech interview or anything. Once I finish the App Brewery work, I'm going to slowly work through Codecademy's Full Stack work just to maintain the knowledge.

### Day 6: June 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished jQuery Simon game! Once I got the code working, I went back into the jQuery documentation to figure out how to make the events responsive so I can play the game on my phone. V excited when it worked!

**Thoughts:** I honestly have no idea how people fully functioned with just vanilla JS. I mean possible? Absolutely. But does jQuery, etc make it so.much.less annoying? Hard yes.

### Day 7: June 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Moved further into the backend work in my bootcamp and am high key excited. Did I spend over an hour cranking out supervillain names with the NPM package for Node? Yes. Am I sorry? No. 

**Thoughts:** Trying to finish the school year while responsible for 150+ high school students, included state and AP testing, and getting seniors ready to graduate while also moving through my bootcamp was rough but I did it, so I can absolutely get through a week of scoring the AP Literature exam while finishing up my bootcamp. Only 27 days left of bootcamp!!!
