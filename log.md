# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started JS for dice game project, debugged.

**Thoughts:** Still sort of struggling with getting started with JS. Think I need to slow down and think more about the logic behind what I need the code to do. Losing my patience pretty quickly when things don't work the first time, but that patience will come with time (hopefully)

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
