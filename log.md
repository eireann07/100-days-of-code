# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started JS for dice game project, debugged.

**Thoughts:** Still sort of struggling with getting started with JS. Think I need to slow down and think more about the logic behind what I need the code to do. Losing my patience pretty quickly when things don't work the first time, but that patience will come with time (hopefully)

### Day 1: May 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Advanced JS and DOM for App Brewery; began working with jQuery library. Completed the Drum Kit game project!

**Thoughts:** Remember to proofread! I spent like 20 minutes frustrated with my code...only to see that I misspelled "button"...

### Day 2: May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the jQuery module in App Brewery and the C Arrays lecture in CS50. Began work on the Simon Game for App Brewery and opened the VS code page for CS50 homework. 

**Thoughts:** It's helpful to have Bri along for the journey...I was super skeptical about paired programming and I think a huge part of that was not knowing how to find other programmers. Having a friend who can look at your code is so helpful.
